00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.100
I heard about this <c.arduino>arduino</c> project, and I saw it online - 

2
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
- and I said 'Wow! <00:00:18.100>a lot of people are starting to talk about this. I should check it out!'

3
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.000
Because we wanted to make a tool for our students that was more modern than what was available on the market at that moment.

4
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.306
For me it was a case of - this is a tool that I could see using <i>myself</i>, and therefore I could believe in actually helping to get it out to a wider world.

5
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Open source hardware means to take back control of what is inside things.

6
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.000
We wanted it to be open source - so everybody could come out, help, and contribute.

7
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For me, that's about giving people the information they need to recreate the piece of hardware for themselves.

8
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm really passionate about <c.arduino>arduino</c>... because I really care about understanding more about how the world works.

9
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.463
My advisors said that... there would come the day when there is more computers than people.

10
00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:20.100
If every computer had a keyboard and mouse... and a screen, it would be impossible to command our lives.

11
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.300
Then we started to figure out that there was a way to get a very nice ecosystem of people...

12
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.400
...participating, and making extensions... making derivatives... and helping...

13
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.400
So it's kind of like I'm taking one step up a ladder. And then I'm helping other people go further up the ladder.

14
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.700
So... we had to simplify the interface. And that's the beginning of a completely new way of looking at... computation.

15

16
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800
The very first thing I tried to do with an <c.arduino>arduino</c> was run a 3D printer.

17
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.500
...so I make moving cakes and singing cakes...

18
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.100
So we make puppets with the <c.arduino>arduino</c>...

19
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.120
One of my students is building a guitar.

20
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.200
Here's a... here's a robot...

21
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.400
If I tilt, you see the light goes left - if I go up...

22
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400
Many people have built helicopters with four or six motors.

23
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.100
Suddenly a message arrived telling us that <c.arduino>arduino</c>...

24
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.000
And obviously I said OK... this is just too much.

25
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It ended up being a 17 year old who made the satellite.
